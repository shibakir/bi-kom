## Basic Domain Description:

The focus of the domain is on the general bureaucratic structure of entities related to
healthcare. The base of all action is a healthcare facility and its owner, some business
entity. These are either private, or state-owned. Private entities are internationally
identifiable and do not depend on a specific state. On the other hand, each state
has its own state entity, the details of which depend on specifics of the underlying
state structure.
We distinguish healthcare facilities into doctor offices (general practitioner, etc.)
and larger composites such as hospitals, which consist of multiple departments. Each
department has one doctor in a leading position and some doctor staff subordinated
to the department and its head. To become the head of department, the doctor
needs a minimum of 10 years of practice experience to retain some respect from his
subordinates.
Every doctor must have a schedule to follow. This schedule is composed of
multiple time slots of varying length to fit different types of visit for which the
patients made an appointment. Visits always occur in the same location that the
doctor works in. That is, the healthcare facility, not department (if they are part of
one), because it can happen that the given department is full in capacity, but other
parts of the facility are available.
Visits are first reserved. After the patient attends the visit, they become com-
pleted. They can also be cancelled, in which case the time slot is no longer usable.
Visits can be without further specification, or of a specific kind, such as a preventive
check-up, which requires at least a 30-minute time window. During a visit, multiple
smaller interventions can be performed. Or, in case of an operation, the visit itself
is a bigger intervention.
Doctors are paid for any intervention that occurred in addition to the completed
visits of every patient. The means of payment are outside our interests.
Patients occasionally need medication with a specific effective substance to cure
their disease. Some medications can only be acquired with a prescription from the
doctor. However, doctors must avoid prescribing patients medications with the same
effective substance as those patients actively use. Medication beyond its due date
becomes unusable. Both individual customers and companies in the private sector
can purchase medication.
